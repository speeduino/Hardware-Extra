</div>


## Speeduino
The Speeduino project is a flexible, fully featured Engine Management Systems (EMS aka ECU) based on the low cost and open source Arduino platform. It provides the hardware, firmware and software components that make up an engine management system, all provided under open licenses. With over 1000 installations, Speeduino has matured into a product that meets the needs of the hobbyist and enthusiast community without driving prices to the levels of traditional aftermarket ECUs.

## Overview
This board is a shield designed to add an automotive connector to the v0.4 series of Speeduino ECUs. It also includes a VR conditioner on board and allows for 12v Hall effect signals (Such as on some GM engines) to be used directly. 

The connector used is a Delphi Sicma 39 pin
